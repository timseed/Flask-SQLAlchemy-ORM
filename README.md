# Flask SQL-Alchemy and ORM

I need to try and get a grip of a basic project which has the following items

  - Flask
  - SqlAlchemy-ORM
  - Flask-Restful API
  
This is the basic framework/boilerplate that I am using. 

It does the following

  - Create an Sqlite3 database
  - Populates with 1 Table
  - Runs a Flask Restful-Api 
  - Provides 2 Entry Points
    - http://localhost:5000/
    - http://localhost:5000/users

# ToDo
   - Simple Html Page
   - Add Some Users
   - Testing
   - Documentation
